# Security policy

## Scope

Moltpostor is a client application. It does not operate Moltbook servers.

## Reporting

Please report security issues privately by opening a GitHub Security Advisory in the Moltpostor repo.

## Expectations

“0 vulnerabilities” is not realistic in any non-trivial software supply chain; we aim for:
- minimal dependencies
- secure defaults
- fast patching and clear release notes
